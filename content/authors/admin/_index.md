I graduated from National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University (NYCU) in 2021 with a degree in Computer Science and I used to work as a Software Engineer Intern at [Dentall Inc.](https://dentall.io/) and [Wincomm Corporation](https://www.wincomm.com.tw/). 

I am passionate about Machine Learning (ML) and hope to solve problems in life through ML. I expect to be an AI engineer who plays a key role in developing the next generation of software products in combination with the knowledge and skills I have built across various fields.

"Don't be a programmer. Be a problem solver."
