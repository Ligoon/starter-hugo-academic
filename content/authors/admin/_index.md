I graduated from National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University (NYCU) in 2021 with a degree in Computer Science and now I am a graduate student at University of Southern California (USC).

I am passionate about Machine Learning (ML) and hope to solve problems in life through ML and I used to work as a Software Engineer Intern (DL) at [Dentall Inc.](https://dentall.io/). Also, I have experience in web development. I develop a website for the Computer Science department at my college. I expect to be an engineer who plays a key role in developing the next generation of software products in combination with the knowledge and skills I have built across various fields.

"Don't be a programmer. Be a problem solver."
